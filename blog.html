                <b>Queering the Folk Tradition: Inside Manchester’s Flourishing Queer Folk Scene</b><br><br>
                Emily Zurowski, 29 July 2025<br><br>
                In a pub tucked away in Manchester’s Gay Village, something special is happening. Every two weeks, a
                group of musicians gather, not just to play music, but to reclaim and reimagine folk traditions through
                a queer lens. This is Queer as Folk (QaF), a grassroots collective celebrating the stories, sounds, and
                resistance woven into both the queer and the folk cultures. As a queer Scottish musician raised around
                (Scottish) folk music, I never really connected these two parts of my identity. That changed when I
                started attending Queer as Folk sessions. What I found was a thriving, subversive, and joyful community
                where tradition and queerness not only coexist, but feed each other.<br><br>
                <b>Where Folk meets Queer</b><br><br>
                On the surface, the folk and queer cultures might seem worlds apart. Folk music is often associated with
                the
                rural past, traditions, and heritage, while queerness, especially as defined in queer theory, is about
                challenging norms and disrupting binaries. One represents continuity, and the other, change. But this
                contrast is precisely what makes their intersection so powerful. Historically, folk music has given
                voice to the marginalised. It’s the sound of rebellion, of protest, and of lives lived outside the
                mainstream. Similarly, queer culture is rooted in resistance out of necessity. When folk and queer
                culture meet, what
                emerges is something deeply impactful: a radical reclaiming of space, sound, and self.<br><br>
                <b>Queer as Folk and Queering Folk</b><br><br>
                Queer as Folk is part of the broader Queer Roots Collective, which aims to foster queer community in
                Manchester through creativity and play. QaF sessions are held at The Molly House, a venue named after
                the 'molly houses' of the 18th century (secret gathering spaces for queer people). QaF provide a really inclusive space: there’s no expectation to be an expert and everyone is encouraged to contribute,
                whether it’s by leading a tune on an instrument, singing along, or just enjoying the music. One of the
                more surprising discoveries that I made at Queer as Folk is just how malleable the folk tradition can
                be, especially in the queer context. Despite its reputation for conservatism in some circles, folk music
                is inherently a living tradition. Of course, we know that folk songs are passed on orally, lyrics shift over time, and melodies morph
                with each new performance. But many members of QaF embrace this flexibility in a distinct way by ‘queering’ folk songs. This
                can mean changing pronouns in pieces, adding subtle lyrical tweaks, or even reinterpreting
                the narrative of traditional ballads. Take Willie O’Winsbury, a classic folk song where a king expresses
                admiration for a man who has impregnated his daughter:<br><br>
                <i>But when he came the king before,He was clad all in the red silk.His hair was like the strands of
                gold,His skin was as white as milk.<br><br>
                “And it is no wonder,” said the king,“That my daughter’s love you did win.If I was a woman, as I am a
                man,My bedfellow you would have been.” </i>(Roud 64)<br><br>
                It's easy to see how this tale can be queered as one man desiring another.
                As one QaF member put it, “...people do find contact and comfort by queering the folk songs … they tweak
                them to make them a little bit queer-er, and that little bit more full of queer joy.”<br><br>
                Place matters, and Manchester, often dubbed the “Queer Capital of the North”, offers fertile ground for
                this hybrid cultural movement. With its long history as a home of musical subcultures and LGBTQ+
                activism, it’s no surprise that a group like Queer as Folk would take root here. The group also perform
                outside of the Gay Village (for example, at Manchester Folk Festival), where their presence carves out queer
                counterpublics in traditionally heteronormative folk spaces. In doing so, they challenge long-standing
                boundaries (geographic, cultural, and aesthetic).<br><br>
                <b>Toward a Queer Folk Future</b><br><br>
                There’s still little written about the intersection of queer life and folk music, but that’s changing.
                Projects like <i>Queer Folkore</i> help to uncover LGBTQ+ stories hidden in folk archives, and artists
                everywhere are queering the canon in personal and political ways. What’s exciting is that this movement
                doesn’t feel like a break from tradition, it feels like its continuation. Folk music has always evolved
                and it has always held the stories of the people who sang it. Those stories are just becoming more
                inclusive, more diverse, and more reflective of the communities keeping the music alive.
                Queer as Folk are at the forefront of this shift in Manchester. They’re not just reclaiming space in
                pubs and at festivals: they’re building a new kind of tradition – one that honours the past while
                queering the future.
